# Pre-Release Change Log

A summary of the changes to the web app will be added to this file with each
production release. For a more detailed history of changes, see the commit
history.

Once the app is complete, the version will be bumped to 1.0 and this change log
will be replaced with one that will track the progress for the rest of the
app's lifetime. This file will still be available in the commit history, of
course.
