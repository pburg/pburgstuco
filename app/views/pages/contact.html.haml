    %strong Hey!
    I see that you're using Internet Explorer. Might you take a moment to try a
    more friendly browser such as
    %a{href: "http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"} Firefox
    or
    = succeed "?" do
      %a{href: "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/"} Chrome
    They're fast, free, extensible, and stay up to date with the latest web
    technology. The more people that switch, the more developers will be able
    to bring you the latest content.
